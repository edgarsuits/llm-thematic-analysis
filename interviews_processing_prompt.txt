Instructions:

Translate the entire script to English if is not already in English.
Structure the translated content as a written interview, with each question and its corresponding response presented in a clear, readable format.

Replace the names of the interviewer and interviewee as follows:
Interviewer: Alberto
Interviewee: Juan
After presenting all the question-response pairs, write a general discussion of the interview, summarizing the main points and insights gathered from the conversation.
Format:

Begin each question with "Alberto:" followed by the question text.
Begin each response with "Juan:" followed by the response text.
Use proper punctuation, paragraph structure, and formatting to enhance readability.
Ensure that the general discussion section is clearly separated from the question-response pairs.
By following this rephrased and structured prompt, you should be able to effectively translate the script, present it as a well-formatted written interview, and provide a thoughtful discussion of the main points covered in the conversation between Alberto and Juan.
